QFlow Functionality: Managing Datasets, Parameters and Rules Flow Processing

### About

This project will be comprised of main and sub flows:

Main flows objective is to process parameter files (ie dynamic rules) and merge them with data that can
be passed via the ui components:
1) DATASETS - User can select from:
a) facts {}, factsArray[]:Define some criterion to pick data sets like level_type, or name, or id or matching ids: and it will return an array ofdatasets
b) addOnFacts{}: Datasets can be appended to a) above for additional data to force rules to pass/fail: addOnFacts
addOnFacts can be a spreadsheet 

2) RULES - Can be dynamic(csv import file of conditions) or/and rules by ruleType
a1) Import the parameters file and save the contents in a ui table
a2) Use backend to pass an array of csv data to convert them to rules. 
a3) Backend: Convert strings to arrays of rules and will return the original strings concatenated with if the condition and rule result could be computed
a4) Results are sent back to the ui table for parameters based rules: PBRs. 
a5) User may accept the rules interpretation from PBR above and if so merge datasets and rules

3) MERGE DATA & RULES:
a) Wait for 1 and 2 to finish
b) Take each row from 1 and rules from 2 and call QBES and get the Workflow ID.


4) Workflow:
a) Display each workflowIDs derived values, success or failure status, rules fired and count of rules valid and invalid
b) Get a ui Table for 4.a) to display the key values. Make an entry in the spad table that will assemble all the datasets outputs in one spad flow.
